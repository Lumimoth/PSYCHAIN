      <HEADER>Game Info</HEADER>
      <br>
      <h>• Controls:</h>
      <p>There are various points through the game that have diffrent controls. 3D sections use WASD for movement with the Mouse to look around.

      <HEADER>Technical Warnings</HEADER>
      <p><i>Contains spoilers: (!) you can hover over the spoilers for places that require more clarification or contain spoilers.</i></p>
      <p>This game (Phantomware 0) will interact with your computer's settings and files in unconventional ways. Below are the effects the game will have on your computer:</p>
      <br><br>

      <h>• Desktop Wallpaper</h>
      <p>Phantomware 0 will modify your desktop wallpaper, creating custom images during gameplay.<br>These images are saved in the game's install directory at: <i>Phantomware 0\Phantomware 0_Data\StreamingAssets</i></p>
      <p><span class="spoiler">​The game will read your desktop wallpaper from your windows registry, It will then make a couple versions of it with various filters. In game, there will be an event where it changes your desktop wallpaper, and after you go back to the game, it will revert it.</span></p>
      <br>

      <h>• Registry Modifications</h>
      <p>Phantomware 0 will access, store, and modify entries in the Windows Registry.</p>
      <p><span class="spoiler">This is to change the desktop wallpaper. (Basically this allows the game to temporarily change desktop wallpaper without any permanent effects).</span></p>
      <br>

      <h>• File Access</h>
      <p>By running Phantomware 0, you grant the game access, storage, and modification to data on all drives of your computer.</p>
      <p><span class="spoiler">The game will access the file to your desktop wallpaper, and create, modify and store data in the games folder <i>Phantomware 0\Phantomware 0_Data\</i>.</span></p>
      <br>

      <h>• Application Interaction</h>
      <p>Phantomware 0 may interact with open applications on your computer, including modifying, opening, or closing them, example: browser.</p>
      <br>

      <h>• Recovery Mode</h>
      <p>All effects caused by Phantomware 0 are automatically reverted when the game is properly closed. In the event of a crash or sudden interruption, the game will attempt to recover and restore your computer's state to its original settings.</p>
      <br>

      <h>• Recording</h>
      <p>This game can be streamed; however, it is recommended to record this experience so unwanted information can be appropriately censored. If you want to stream this game here are some things in particular you might want to know about… <b>[CONTAINS SPOILERS]</b></p>
      <p><span class="spoiler">Phantomware 0 contains an immersive scare that directly interacts with your desktop.<br><br>
		At a certain point in the game, Phantomware 0 will minimize itself and reveal your actual desktop, replacing your wallpaper with a custom horror image as part of a scripted jumpscare. During this moment, anything on your desktop — including icons, files, and shortcuts — will be visible.<br><br>
		If you do not want viewers to see what’s on your desktop, please take time beforehand to hide or clean up any sensitive or personal files, folders, or icons. This includes removing shortcuts, documents, or any content you wouldn’t want appearing on stream or in a recording.<br><br>
		As part of the scare, the game will also generate a temporary “README.txt” file on your desktop. Both the wallpaper and the file will automatically revert/disappear once you return to the game by maximizing the window.<br><br>
		This feature is purely cosmetic and non-malicious, intended to enhance the psychological horror experience.<br><br>
		✅ No personal data is collected or uploaded.<br>
		✅ No webcam, microphone, or folder access is used.<br>
		✅ Only your wallpaper is temporarily changed, and one file is briefly placed on the desktop.</span></p>
